Sometimes you might want to preprocess the content of a specific component only.
For example, maybe you have a component `Code` in which you want to be able to
include characters that might confuse the Svelte parser (like `{` or `}`)
without having to manually escape them. In that case, you can add an entry to
the `verbatimEnvironments` array of the Sveltex configuration as follows:

```ts sveltex.config.ts
export const sveltex = await sveltexPreprocessor({
    general: {
        verbatimEnvironments: {
            Code: {
                type: 'code',
                forwardAllAttributes: true,
            },
            Verbatim: {
                type: {
                    escapeBraces: true,
                    escapeBackticks: true,
                },
            },
        },
    },
    markdown: {
        code: {
            backend: 'highlight.js',
        },
    },
});
```
