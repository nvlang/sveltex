## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Otherwise:

```bash
pnpm dlx create-sveltex # If using PNPM
bunx create-sveltex     # If using Bun
npx create-sveltex      # If using NPM
yarn dlx create-sveltex # If using Yarn
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies, start a development
server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can then preview the production build with the following:

```bash
pnpm run preview
```
{{#if (contains tools 'husky')}}
{{#if git}}
{{else}}

## Troubleshooting

### Husky hooks not running

Be sure to run `{{packageManager}} install` at least once _after_ initializing
your git repository to ensure that Husky's hooks are set up correctly. If that
still doesn't fix the issue, ensure that the `prepare` script in `package.json`
is `husky` or `svelte-kit sync && husky` and run `{{packageManager}} install`
again. If you're still having trouble, consult the [Husky
documentation](https://typicode.github.io/husky/troubleshoot.html).
