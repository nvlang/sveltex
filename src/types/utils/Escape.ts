     * If {@link enabled | `markdown.directives.enabled`} is `true`, SvelTeX
     * uses
     * [`micromark-extension-directive`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/micromark-extension-directive)
     * internally to determine whether a pair of braces should be considered
     * part of a directive or not. I personally like the syntax for directives
     * proposed there, but for some it might feel too strict. Since, as far as I

     * expect). Accordingly, this setting is provided for those that may want to
     * loosen the syntax. (Note: You can't use this setting to make the syntax
     * _more_ strict.)
     *
     * If this setting is set to a function, said function will be used to

     * should be considered part of a directive or not.
     *
     * @remarks
     * If set to `null`, this will be effectively equivalent to `() => false`.
     *
     * @remarks
     * âš  **Warning**: If you make the syntax for directives looser than that of
     * whatever plugin you're passing to your markdown processor to handle
     * directives, you can get unexpected results. For example, if you set this
     * setting to `() => true`, and are using
     * [`remark-directive`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-directive) (which
     * follows the same syntax for directives as
     * `micromark-extension-directive`) then the following markdown...
     *
     * ```markdown
     * ::: example { 1*2*3 }
     * text
     * :::
     * ```
     *
     * ...would become...
     *
     * ```html
     * <p>::: example { 1<em>2</em>3 }
     * text
     * :::</p>
     * ```
     *
     * ...before it is passed to the Svelte compiler. This is not only probably
     * not what you want, but also not valid Svelte, since `1<em>2</em>3` is not
     * valid JavaScript.
     *
     * @example
     * Suppose the following markdown is encountered:
     *
     * ```markdown
     * text 1
     * ::: directive {#id .class key=value}
     * content
     * :::
     * text 2
     * ```
     *
     * Then, in order to decide whether `{#id .class key=value}` should be
     * considered a Svelte mustache tag (in which case it would be escaped
     * before the markdown processor gets a chance to parse it) or a part of a
     * directive (in which case it wouldn't be escaped, so that the markdown
     * parser can parse it), the `bracesArePartOfDirective` function would be
     * called with the following arguments:
     *
     * ```ts
     * bracesArePartOfDirective({
     *     document: 'text 1\n'
     *         + '::: directive {#id .class key=value}\n'
     *         + 'content\n'
     *         + ':::\n'
     *         + 'text 2',
     *     innerContent: '#id .class key=value',
     *     loc: { start: 21, end: 42 },
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Note that the `loc` object contains character offsets, and that
     * `document.slice(loc.start, loc.end)` would return the string `'{#id
     * .class key=value}'`, i.e., would include the braces.
     *
     * @example
     * The following function would _partially_ imitate the syntax of
     * `micromark-extension-directive`:
     *
     * ```ts
     * const bracesArePartOfDirective = ({
     *     document,
     *     loc,
     * }: {
     *     document: string;
     *     loc: { start: number; end: number };
     * }) => {
     *     const { end } = loc;
     *     const trimmed = document.slice(0, end);
     *     return directiveRegex.test(trimmed);
     * };
     * ```
     *
     * In the above, `directiveRegex` would be the following regex (presented
     * here in the extended regex format for readability):
     *
     * ```
