## Purpose

Sveltex (a portmoneau of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and
[TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX), and interchangeably stylized as
"SvelTeX") is a
[preprocessor](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-compiler#preprocess) for Svelte.
It is similar to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (which is made for
[React](https://react.dev/)) in that it allows you to write markdown in
components and components in markdown. The intended effect is to improve the
developer experience by speeding up your workflow and making Svelte files more
readable.

## How it works

Sveltex, like any other Svelte preprocessor, is ultimately a function that
transforms (some of) a user's Svelte files before they are passed to the Svelte
compiler. The following is a high-level overview of how it does this:

<Steps>
<Step title="Parse File">
Sveltex uses Svelte's own parser (after escaping some special characters, if
necessary) to assign one of four categories to some subsets of a Svelte
file's content:
-   **Markdown**: Anything that the Svelte parser interpreted as plain text and
    does not belong to one of the other categories.
-   **Code**: Inline code (`` `...` ``) or fenced code blocks (` ```...``` `).
-   **TeX**: Inline math (`$...$`) or display math (`$$...$$`).
-   **Verbatim**: Content that is found inside of a (non-standard) HTML tag that
    was previously configured as a so-called "verbatim" environment (which
    refers to the fact that its content may include characters that would
    normally interfere with Svelte's parser and compiler, such as curly
    brackets). Verbatim environments can be put into two categories:
    -   **Advanced TeX**: This is intended for TeX code which is too complex for
        MathJax or KaTeX to render, and hence should be rendered using a user's
        local texlive distribution. This could be anything from
        [PGF/TikZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ) illustrations or
        [tikz-cd](https://ctan.org/pkg/tikz-cd) diagrams to complex systems of equations
        that for require features that only a full TeX distribution can offer.
    -   _Everything else:_ For example, this may be content that is intended to
        be rendered as a special code block, or content which includes special
        characters that should be automatically escaped.
</Step>
<Step title="Delegate">
Content from each of the four main categories described above is forwarded to a
dedicated "handler" for processing (markdown gets forwarded to a "markdown
handler", and so on). Some of these handlers may use a peer dependency as their
backend to process content (for example, a user may want to use the
[unified](https://unifiedjs.com/) to render their markdown,
[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to render their math, and
[starry-night](https://github.com/wooorm/starry-night) to highlight their code
blocks; or some other combination, of course).

Advanced TeX content is compiled with the user's local texlive distribution,
cached, and transformed into an SVG component which is then automatically
imported to the Svelte file whose code generated it and inserted where the
advanced TeX code used to be.

</Step>
</Steps>

## How it compares

The most popular markdown preprocessor for Svelte, as far as I can tell, is
[MDsveX](https://github.com/pngwn/MDsveX). It is a phenomenal tool developed by
a Svelte contributor, and is much more mature than Sveltex. The biggest
difference between the two is the prioritization of the TeX integration in
Sveltex, particularly Sveltex ability to make use of a user's local texlive
distribution. I'd encourage anyone to try both and see which one they prefer,
but if you're in a rush or don't need the advanced TeX features, MDsveX may well
be the better choice for you.

## Roadmap

Sveltex is still in its early stages, and there are many features that I would
like to add. Some of these include:

-   Support for TeX compilation on external servers
    ([Overleaf](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/tree/main/services/clsi),
    [TeXLive.net](https://texlive.net/), etc.).
-   Improve support for "document-level" markdown features (esp. footnotes).
