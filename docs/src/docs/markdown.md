In order of recommendation:

- unified: The backbone of MDX (among many other things), [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/) has the
  largest ecosystem of plugins, many of which are maintained by the core team.
  Furthermore, it has several big
  [sponsors](https://opencollective.com/unified), so it's continued maintenance
  and
  development is all but assured.

  The only downsides that I can think of are that the sheer size of the
  ecosystem can be somewhat overwhelming (especially due to its highly
  modularized nature, though said modularity is also a big advantage in many
  other ways), and that, in my view, plugin development or low-level
  customization within the Unified.js ecosystem has a rather steep learning
  curve. However, this only matters if you're actually planning to develop
  plugins or do low-level customization, which, given the vastness of the plugin
  ecosystem, will probably not be necessary in the majority of use-cases.

- `markdown-it`: Used by many SSGs, including Eleventy, Hugo, and VuePress. Has
  a solid ecosystem of plugins, and is generally well-maintained.

- `micromark`: The parser powering unified, this is

- `marked`
