# Optimization



## SVGO

SvelTeX uses [SVGO] to optimize SVG files. This is in addition to the
optimizations that `dvisvgm` already performs.

At the cost of a few extra milliseconds of processing time, SVGO can often
reduce the size of the generated SVG files by â‰¥20% (see [benchmarks] for examples).
